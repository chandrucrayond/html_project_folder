      In this example, .flex-container represents the class name of the element
      that uses flex in Bootstrap. By setting max-width to none and using the
      !important declaration, you ensure that this style takes precedence over
      the default Bootstrap style. Place this custom CSS code in a separate CSS
      file or within the tags in your HTML file, and make sure that the custom
      CSS file is loaded after the Bootstrap CSS file so that the override takes
      effect. Remember to replace .flex-container with the actual class name or
      selector of the element you want to modify. User Refused to apply style
      from 'http://127.0.0.1:5500/html_project_folder/css/styles.css' because
      its MIME type ('text/html') is not a supported stylesheet MIME type, and
      strict MIME checking is enabled. ChatGPT The error message you're
      encountering suggests that the server is not properly serving the CSS file
      with the correct MIME type. To resolve this issue, you can try the
      following steps: Verify the CSS file path: Double-check that the path to
      the CSS file is correct. Ensure that it matches the actual location of the
      file in your project. Check server configuration: If you're using a local
      development server, such as Live Server or BrowserSync, make sure it is
      configured to serve CSS files with the correct MIME type. Check the server
      settings or configuration files to ensure that .css files are being served
      with the MIME type text/css. Clear browser cache: Clear your browser cache
      and reload the page. Sometimes, the browser cache can interfere with MIME
      type detection. MIME type configuration: If you're using a server
      environment like Apache or Nginx, you might need to configure the server
      to serve CSS files with the correct MIME type. In Apache, you can add or
      modify the following line in the .htaccess file:
